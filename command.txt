1) Generate Component using Angular CLI
>ng g c <component_name>
This command will also update the app.module and register this new component in the declarations section

1) Generate Service using Angular CLI
>ng g s <service_name>
This command will NOT update the app.module and register this new service in the providers section,
For service manually need to insert it, not same as component
