1) Generate Component using Angular CLI
>ng g c <component_name>
This command will also update the app.module and register this new component in the declarations section

2) Generate Service using Angular CLI
>ng g s <service_name>
This command will NOT update the app.module and register this new service in the providers section,
For service manually need to insert it, not same as component

3) To use bootstrap , need to install bootstrap by running this command.
>npm install bootstrap@3.3.7 --save 
npm install bootstrap : download bootstrap and store it in nodemodules folder
--save : add bootstrap as dependency in package.json
3.3.7 is version , leave it empty for latest

to uninstall
>npm uninstall bootstrap --save 

you can see the version added into package.json in dependency section
"bootstrap": "^3.3.7",
major.minor.patch , so you can install up to version 4 major version 3.4 / 3.9 
but not version 4,5,6,7 of major than that

4) once installed bootstrap need to import it in the global css stylesheet which is styles.css,
there import the node modules path of the bootstrap

5) >npm install
when execute this , angular will download all the dependency based on package.json and store it
in node modules as this node modules folder will not be in source control/git and take alot of spaces.

6) when use ngModel first time you can get this error
Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input'.
FIX: Import FormsModule which contain this ngModel in the app.module.ts under imports section

7) For new custom pipe(.ts file) created , we need to import in the app.module.ts 
under declaration section as well same like component
