<h1>Angular</h1>

instead of using property binding wiht input properties , we goind to use ngContent element
<bootstrap-panel>
    <div class="heading">Heading</div>
    <div class="body">
        <h2>Body</h2>
        <p>Some content here....</p>
    </div>
</bootstrap-panel>

<app-pipes-courses></app-pipes-courses>
<courses></courses>

<!-- will get error that it isn't a know property of favourite 
in order to use property binding you need to define the property.
in order to make component more reusable we need to use input property to pass input/state to component 
and output property to raise event from this custom component. combination of this make it as public API-->

<!-- now using is-favourite alias name as specified in favourite.component.ts -->
<app-favourite [is-favourite]="post.isFavourite" (change)="onFavChange()"></app-favourite>
